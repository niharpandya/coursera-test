<p id="p1">Taco Bell officially launched its hotly anticipated Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos on Thursday, the day after fans revolted over expectations that the item would be available Wednesday.The new offering was preceded to the menu by the Nacho Cheese taco, which has sold more than 350 million units and is considered by the Irvine company to be its most successful product launch in its 51-year history.The run-up to the Cool Ranch debut was accompanied by a massive social media push and special events, including password-only previews for fans in New York, Dallas and Los Angeles.Taco Bell plans to market the item with its largest campaign ever, including a 3-D commercial set to play in many movie theaters across the country.</p>

<p id="p2">The menu's launch included a campaign featuring two dozen Ronald McDonalds (everyday men, not the red-haired clown) chowing down on Taco Bell breakfast items.McDonald's, however, wasn't going to stand by idly. On Friday, the world's biggest hamburger chain announced it would offer a free small cup of coffee to customers for two weeks beginning Monday.“This event is McDonald’s way of encouraging new guests to try McCafé Coffee while giving our breakfast lovers even more reason to enjoy the great taste of our signature blend," said Greg Watson, senior vice president of McDonald’s U.S. menu innovation, in a statement.For their part, McDonald's wouldn't directly say the free coffee promotion was in response to Taco Bell's new breakfast rollout.</p>
